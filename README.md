# aadd-cp

This project aims at exploring the use of affine algebraic decision diagrams (AADD) to deal with mathematical expressions in Constraint Programming (CP).
We use the choco-solver library to create a new propagator called DDPropagator in package "src/cp", that represents and propagate over a mathematical expression.
The other packages are the code to manipulate and visualize decision diagrams.

This is a Java project and can be directly import into Eclipse or IntelliJ.

Three libraries, that can be found in "lib", must be imported to the Java project.
